                <p class="details">I am a 24 year old living in Nashville, Tennessee. I am originally from Kanakakee, IL. My hobbies include: snowboarding, playing video games, and hanging out with friends. I went to school at The University of Tennessee at Knoxville, GO VOLS and graduated in 2018 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I always enjoyed coding in school and am looking for a change in careers and purpue something that I am passionate about. The last thing about me is that I like to live my life by this famous quote: 
                    <blockquote cite="https://quotesnsmiles.com/quotes/70-brilliant-oscar-wilde-quotes/">
                        <p>“Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”</p>
                        <footer>– Oscar Wilde</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="oscar">Oscar Wilde was an author, playwright and poet in late Victorian England, I learned about him in school and really enjoy his play The Importance of Being Earnest.</p>
