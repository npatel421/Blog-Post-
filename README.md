# Blog Page Project

This project is to showcase HTML and CSS skills that I have learned with the Udacity program. 

## Motivation

The blog includes two entries. One is an about me page that lets the audience learn more about me and my interests. One of my interests including playing a video game, Dota 2, so natually my second blog post was about one of the characters from the game.

## Features

This project includes hyperlinks that allow the user to navigate from the homepage to the blog pages and back. Homepage also includes a subscriber field in which they can enter their email address if they enjoy the content of the blog. Something to enchance this project and that I want to do in the future is actually store the input from the user into a database with an event listener tied into the submit button.

## Get Started

Open up your favorite internet browser. I personally like to use Google Chrome. Then open the **homepage.html** file from the repo. This will allow you to see the homepage and access the hyperlinks to the other pages that I created for my blog page.
